- 👋 Hi, I’m @porterbaker
- 👀 I’m interested in artificial intelligence, computational intelligence, neuroscience, data science/analysis, and software engineering!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development in hopes of creating my own website to show my experience, work experience, and skills. I'm also learning Python in hopes of mastering it for data science and future machine learning programming. I'll hopefully be posting projects I create here.
