# Jackson P. Baker

I am a Computer Science graduate from the **University of Mississippi**, current IT professional, master's student at **Mississippi State University**, and a lifelong learner and enthusiast of computers, mathematics, and the vast domains of science. I'm currently learning how to use Github in my personal project management as well as a tool for my graduate coursework and storing it efficiently (my laptop storage is also small....) and programming in **Python, R, and Rust**. I'm currently working on personal projects in algorithmic security trading, blockchain development, natural language processing, web development, and a secret project for my girlfriend :). 

*Welcome to my github!*
